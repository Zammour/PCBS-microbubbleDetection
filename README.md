# PCBS-microbubbleDetection

*The diffraction-limit has long represented an unreachable summit to conquer in ultrasound imaging. Within a few years after the introduction of optical localization microscopy, we proposed its acoustic alter-ego that exploits the micrometric localization of microbubble contrast agents to reconstruct the finest vessels in the body in-depth. [...] It has since been used in-vivo in the brain, the kidney and in tumors. In the clinic, ULM is bound to improve drastically our vision of the microvasculature, which could revolutionize the diagnosis of cancer, arteriosclerosis, stroke and diabetes, among others.*<br>

In clinics, echography is widely used to detect vessels and uses the well-known Doppler-effect. We can increase considerably the images by injecting parenterally contrast agent that are microbubbles of gas. We can further increase the acquisition time to detect microvessels up to tens of Âµm.

In this project, we aim to model *in silico* vessels by simulating microbubble loclization. Then, we will try to separate the microbubbles depending on their speed to improve detection, as in [*C. Huang et al., 2020*](<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62898-9>).
